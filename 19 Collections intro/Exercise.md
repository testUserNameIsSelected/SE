# Write a Java program to print the first 15 numbers of the Pell series.

* In mathematics, the Pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers.
* The sequence of Pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and then each Pell number is the sum of twice the previous Pell
  number and the Pell number before that.:
    * thus, 70 is the companion to 29, and 70 = 2 × 29 + 12 = 58 + 12.
    * The first few terms of the sequence are :
      0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378, 5741, 13860,…
